    <div class="question">Michael didn't have a happy childhood and he lived with different host families. He had a good heart. Once, after
        a volleyball match, he offered to clean up the rubbish. Annie's family saw it and Annie decided to adopt
        Michael. Then, she helped him get into a high school. Michael was gifted in football. Annie planned to make him
        a good football player. Michael didn't do well at the beginning, because he lacked experience. He felt so sorry
        that he wanted to give up. But Annie encouraged him. She told Michael that the team was like a family and
        everyone played an important role in it. Michael decided to carry on. He practiced harder and he also met a good
        coach. He helped Michael a lot and later Michael made great progress. In the end, Michael got into a good
        college and became an excellent football player.</div>
